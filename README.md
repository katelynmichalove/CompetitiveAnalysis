#### Positioning

"Bringing creative projects to life". 

Kickstarter is selling creative project funding in many different categories such as publishing, film, design & tech, arts, comics and illustration, games, food & crafts, and music. These are all creative and fun categories. 

They present the number of projects already funded and the number of people contributing to the funding process. 

"Let go of the idea of greatness. Wanting to be great is really limiting"

They appear to be promoting that no project is too small, it is easy and fun to start a project, and there are plenty of people in the world looking to fund projects. Don't take yourself too seriously, be yourself and see where your project goes. 

Kickstarter promotes their hand picked selection of projects along with the current popular projects among users. They sell their product through letting the user explore different categories and allowing them to look at the top projects as a glimpse into what the site offers. They promote the general ease and show that the project could be small so that you will begin creating your first project. 

Kickstarter is for creative projects only. 

Kickstarter communicates their product through examples of other projects they could fund along with their success. The page is full of pictures of the projects with a title to describe it along with the percentage of funding they have achieved. On the homepage it shows projects with well over a 100% funding, promoting the success of their many projects. 

If you are interested in starting a project, you can click to start one and they will answer some common questions to show how easy it is to start and maintain a project on their site. Their method of communication is useful and easy to follow. 

#### Primary Audience

Kickstarter's primary audience seems to be the millenial consumer ages 22-37 which is about half of their users. There is a wide range of price offerings for funding a project depending on what the user can afford and is willing to give. Anywhere from $5 to over $10,000. 

For starting a project, it will cost 5% of total funds raised plus 3-5% payment processing fee. These fees are only paid if the project is funded successfully. 

Their copy and imagery is very clean and minimalist which appeals to millenials. Since they focus only on creative projects, they appeal to the more creative and artistic individual. The people they focus on believe that anything is possible and aren't afraid to go for it and try out their ideas, better known entrepreneurs 

The majority of kickstarter users is also said to be male. The website is mostly black and white with the only color coming from the images themselves. The font style also looks be more masculine. 

#### Differentiators 

Kickstarter has found a niche of creative entrepreneurs, in which there are many. While indiegogo seems to be more broad. Kickstarter is very simple compared to the other sites, minimalist in a way. There are a smaller number of categories and you simply decide how much to fund for another project or start your own. While Patreon also appeals to creative people, kickstarter is more focused on funding a single project, idea, or new company. Patreon is more focused on continuued support or showing patronage. 

The ability to save the projects you are interested in is a nice feature on kickstarter. There is an ability to comment, see updates, look at FAQs, see how many are supporting the project, and look at the rewards associated with funding at different levels of cost. It also tells you how much of the goal has been reached and the amount of days left to reach that goal. Overall it is very simple and easy to use. 

Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform in which you have to reach your goal in order to receive funding. This incentivizes others to fund them, but means they lose out on funding if the goal is not reached. 

Kickstarter has a large amount of reward levels or tiers to choose from when funding a project.
